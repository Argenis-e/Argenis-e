- 👋 Hi, I’m @Argenis-e
- 👀 I’m interested in developing and sharpening my coding skills, I feel like I am more of a back end person, than a front end one.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, but I can change focus if need be. I just want to be job ready so I can start getting actual real experience before I graduate. :)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on just about anything that is within my scope of abilities, like... Jr level stuff.
- 📫 How to reach me? Hmm... is this safe? Haha
